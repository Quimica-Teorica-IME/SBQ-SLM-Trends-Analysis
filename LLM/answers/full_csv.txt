Resistance against antimalarials have been increasing and have been reported for artemisinin-based combination therapies, first-line treatment for malaria. The search for new antimalarial agents is therefore important. Lapachol and febrifugine are substances with antimalarial activity with potential for the development of new antimalarials. In this work, we propose the synthesis of a hybrid formed by lapachol and 4-hydroxyquinazoline, a pharmacophoric group of febrifugine, that will be connected by a silicon tether.

Abstract,The synthesis of 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole is based on the cyclization of 2-nitroaniline with sodium hypochlorite catalyzed by TBAB in a basic medium followed by reduction of N-oxide group using PPh₃ in xylene to result in heterocycle 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (1) in 75% yield. Subsequent steps involve bromination and Sonogashira coupling reactions to obtain the desired compound. The final product's synthesis was confirmed through ¹H NMR spectrum analysis. An efficient synthetic route leading to the desired compound with an 88% yield is reported, and further analyses for thermal stability, photochemical evaluation, and OLED prototype development are ongoing.
Summary,The study reports a new synthesis method of a 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole derivative involving cyclization, bromination, and Sonogashira coupling reactions.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a child selected at random from among the children of all the couples is a girl. 

Here are the details given in the problem:

- There are 4 married couples.
- Each couple has 3 children.

This means there are a total of \(4 \times 3 = 12\) children.

We know that:
- In 2 couples, all 3 children are boys.
- In one couple, exactly 1 child is a boy.
- In the remaining couple, exactly 2 children are boys.

Let's break this down:

1. **Couples with all boys:**
   - Number of such couples = 2
   - Total children from these couples = \(2 \times 3 = 6\)
   - All these 6 children are boys.

2. **Couple with exactly 1 boy:**
   - Number of such couples = 1
   - Total children from this couple = 3
   - Boys = 1, Girls = 2

3. **Couple with exactly 2 boys:**
   - Number of such couples = 1
   - Total children from this couple = 3
   - Boys = 2, Girls = 1

Now, let's calculate the total number of girls:

- From the couple with exactly 1 boy: 2 girls
- From the couple with exactly 2 boys: 1 girl

Total number of girls = \(2 + 1 = 3\)

Total number of children = 12

The probability that a randomly selected child is a girl is given by:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of girls}}{\text{Total number of children}} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the probability that the selected child is a girl is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

To determine the number of times "B" occurs in the given sequence without counting any occurrences that appear as part of other words or sequences, we need to analyze each character independently and ensure they are standalone letters.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Standalone 'B':**  
   We look for instances where 'B' appears alone and is not surrounded by other alphanumeric characters that would form a word or sequence.

2. **Analyze the Sequence:**  
   The sequence provided is very long and contains various symbols, numbers, and letters. We need to focus on finding standalone occurrences of 'B'.

3. **Counting Standalone 'B':**  
   As we scan through the sequence, we identify each 'B' that appears without any adjacent alphanumeric characters that would form a word or part of another character.

4. **Verification:**  
   Ensure that no 'B' is part of a larger word or sequence by checking its surrounding characters.

After carefully analyzing the sequence, we find:

- The first standalone 'B' occurs after the symbol ``.
- The second standalone 'B' appears after ``.
- The third standalone 'B' is found following ``.

Each of these occurrences is isolated and not part of any larger word or sequence.

**Conclusion:**  
The letter "B" occurs **3 times** as a standalone character in the given sequence.

Methods,"Spectroscopy and crystallography were employed in the study to investigate the properties of two metal complexes."

Results,"The spectroscopic analysis revealed significant differences between the two compounds, C1 and C2. In complex C1, NMR spectra showed characteristic chemical shifts at various ppm values with specific coupling constants (J-values), while for C2, similar but distinct shifts were observed due to spatial interactions attributed to iodide's larger ionic radius. Mass spectrometry indicated that in C1, the chloride ion remained coordinated under analysis conditions, as evidenced by the absence of a certain peak and the presence of other species' peaks. Conversely, C2 showed peaks corresponding to both [Zn(bmimapy)]2+ and [bmimapy]+ ions. Crystallographic studies using X-ray diffraction (XRD) of powder samples revealed completely different packing patterns for both complexes, with C1 exhibiting a trigonal bipyramidal geometry in its crystal form."

Experimental Conditions,"NMR spectra were recorded at 500.13 MHz using a BBFO probe in MeOD solvent with concentrations at 16.7 mg/mL. Spectral processing involved zero filling and digital resolution of 0.16 Hz/pt. Mass spectrometry analysis was conducted under ESI+ conditions, and X-ray diffraction studies provided insights into the crystal structures."

Keywords,Dereplication; Porcelia macrocarpa; Acetylenic fatty acids; Anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity
Abstract,Acetylenic fatty acids are found in various plants and fungi and have shown promising biological activities, including anti-cancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant properties. They also exhibit antiparasitic potential against organisms like Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma cruzi, which cause malaria and Chagas disease respectively. The study aimed to identify acetylenic fatty acids in Porcelia macrocarpa seeds, known for their use in treating hypertension and diabetes. The seeds were analyzed using chromatographic techniques such as UHPLC-MS/ESI(-) and HPLC-DAD/PDA coupled with an ESI(+) probe electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (EPI MS). A total of ten acetylenic fatty acids were identified, nine of which are new to literature. This study advances the understanding of P. macrocarpa's chemical composition and supports its ethnopharmacological uses.
