# 🧪 RASBQ Abstract Analysis with Small Language Models (SLMs)

This project explores how **Small Language Models (SLMs)** can be used to analyze the evolution of Chemistry in Brazil through abstracts submitted to the Brazilian Chemical Society (SBQ) annual meetings. We applied modern NLP techniques to extract thousands of scientific abstracts from the 2019 and 2024 editions of RASBQ.

git clone https://github.com/Quimica-Teorica-IME/SBQ-SLM-Trends-Analysis.git
cd SBQ-SLM-Trends-Analysis
```
## ⚙️ Install Ollama and Phi-4 Model
This project requires a Small Language Model (SLM) to run locally. We recommend Ollama for simple and efficient execution.

Install Ollama
Visit https://ollama.com/download and follow installation instructions for your OS (macOS, Windows, or Linux).

Run the phi4 model
After installing Ollama, open a terminal and run:
```bash
ollama run phi4
```
> Once everything is installed, you're ready to run the scripts or notebooks.
